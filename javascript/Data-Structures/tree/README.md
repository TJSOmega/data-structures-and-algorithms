This is a build out of a tree structure and its major methods, included in this is also the build out of a binary search tree (The primary difference of which is the adding of data into specific positions.)

## Challenge
 Create a binary tree and the methods: PreOrder, PostOrder, and inOrder as well as the add method on a BST(Binary Search Tree).
