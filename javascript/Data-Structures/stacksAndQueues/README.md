# Stacks and Queues
<!-- This is a test of the Stacks and Queues data methods and their primary methods-->

## Challenge
<!-- Create a stack and a Queue and be able to call methods on both data structures -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!--Approach was to create a node class and then create a stack and queue class and pull them into my index where I could run methods off of them. Most methods have a Big O notation of O1 -->

## API
<!--Publicly available methods used in this project were push, pop, and shift.-->


## Psuedo Queue
**added 3/29/2021**
<!--Added psuedoQueue() with an Enqueue and Dequeue method that uses 2 stacks that invert on each method in order to out put the right item.-->
