#  Insterted Shift Array

**Problem Domain**:Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"







 

## Challenge

## Approach & Efficiency

- Create a Linked list. 

- Start with a class called Node,

- Link that into our LinkedList class

- Create required methods for inserting, 

- Create required method for checking if the Linked List includes an item

- Create method for printing the entire list to a string.

**Append**: Created and Append method that adds an item to the end of a linked list

**Insert Before:** Created a method that Inserts an item before a given value if it is apart of the Linked List.

**Insert After:** Created a method that Inserts an item after a given value if it is apart of the Linked List.

**k Number from the End:** Created a method that takes in a value, and through use of a counter and a pointer selects the item at the given value starting from the back of the Linked List.

**Zipping 2 Linked Lists:** Created a function that accepts 2 LinkLists and applies them to one singular linkedList.
